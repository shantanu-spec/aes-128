ADVANCED ENCRYPTION SYSTEM  - 128 Bytes
I have built AES for an embedded device that has a fixed, master secret key that will never change during the life time of the device.
Given,
Input Plaintext = ’00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff’.
Secret Key = ’000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f’.

This programmed can be reprogrammed to encrypt any plaintext with your secret key.
To run:
1. Clone Repository
2. Run :$gcc aes.cpp -o aes.exe
3. Run:aes.exe


NOT TO BE USED COMMERCIALLY AS THIS IS ONLY AN ACADEMIC PROJECT.
